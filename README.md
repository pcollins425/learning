# Learning

This is the repository where I keep my learning projects. There won't be any HTML or CSS since I've been working with them since 2012, but anything else I'm working on will be here.

I worked in marketing but went to school for web and graphic design. There is another location where I host my design work. My goal is to move into data analytics, probably doing business analysis or market analysis. During my journey, I have started working on SQL, Python, and revisiting Javascript...mostly SQL. 

The codes and projects in this repository will not be impressive by any means, but that is not the point. This is more of a progression diary to keep myself going as time starts to wear on me.

If you are reading this, all I ask is for words of encouragement and maybe some tips that have helped you.

Thank You,
